IBM is responding after internal communications submitted as part of a court filing in an age discrimination case showed executives called older workers "dinobabies" who should be "extinct." The filing also contains other emails, including officials' complaints about IBM's "dated maternal workforce" and frustration that its share of millennials was lower than a competitor. IBM maintains that it never took part in systematic age discrimination and only laid off workers for reasons related to business conditions, not age.
